# PokeUI
Welcome to the **PokeUI** theme! This theme is designed specifically for the RetroFE launcher on Funkey OS. I created this theme for my Pokemon only game collection, so **THE ONLY SYSTEMS WITH DESIGNED ICONS ARE THE ONES WITH POKEMON GAMES**, the other systems have general icons.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install the PekeUI theme on your RetroFE setup:

1. **Download the Theme**:
   - Download the latest release as a ZIP file

2. **Extract the Theme**:
   - If downloaded as a ZIP, extract the contents to a folder on your computer

3. **Copy to Your Device**:
   - Transfer the theme folder to your Funkey OS SD card: /mnt/Funkey/.retrofe/layouts/
   - Remember to edit the layouts.list that is present on the /mnt/Funkey/.retrofe/layouts/ folder and add a line with the name of the theme (=folder name)

4. **Activate the Theme**:
   - Press the Menu (on/off) button
   - Use the DPad (up/down keys) to find the theme selector
   - Choose the RetroUI theme
   - Confirm selection
   - ENJOY!
